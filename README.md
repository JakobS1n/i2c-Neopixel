# i2c-Neopixel <font color="red">- Discontinued</font>
This project make the Raspberry Pi able to controll neopixels. This is achieved by sending commands to a atmega328p-chip (Arduino Uno?). Unfortunately this was painfully slow, as i wanted to controll 400+ pixels. I will leave the library here, but not work more on it!
