# i2c-Neopixel <font color="red">- Discontinued</font>
This project makes the Raspberry Pi able to control neopixels. This is achieved by sending commands through the i2c protocol, to an atmega328p (Arduino Uno). Unfortunately this was painfully slow, as I wanted to control 400+ pixels. I will leave the library here, but I will not work more on it!
